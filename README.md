# Overview
Evaluating credit risk can be challenging since it is a unbalanced classification problem. With this type of problem, it is necessary to look at multiple models to determine which one fits best. The fact that good loans significantly outnumber the risky loans is the reason why the additional time should be taken to evaluate this. The cost of a bad loan is also very high which is why this is an important issue to tackle.

# Results
Six models were evaluated to deterine which one that provides the best at predicting if a loan will default or not. Below is a brief summary of the model and how it performed. The same data set was used for each of the models. To evaluate each model, the data set was split into a training data and test data. The training data was used to predict the outcome of the test data. The are three measures that were used to determine how successful the model was at predicting the riskly loans.
